# Maledetta-Tre-Est-App
Project for the University Bachelor Degree Course of Mobile Computing (A.A. 2020-2021)

TreEst is a railway transport company. Unfortunately, TreEst trains are often late, crowded or even cancelled. 
In addition to these problems, passengers (especially commuters who use TreEst every day) complain that TreEst provides little information on the status of trains.
To address these problems, passengers organized themselves and created the “Maledetta TreEst” system. 
The purpose of the system is to allow passengers to share information on the status of trains with each other.

The aim of this project is to create an android app and its respective cross platform app (using the cordova plugin). 
In this repository you can find the src of the Android application and the www of Cordova where there is the code to run the platform.
